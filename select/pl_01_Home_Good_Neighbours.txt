It's a light relief
rom a bad habit
It's my mother's cookin'
when I can't have it
It's the last train home
from the day trippin'
It's the place I go
hen I start slipping
Darling won't you take me home?
Send me shivers somewhere
I used to go
Wrap my name across your mouth
When I let my feelings out
Darling won't you take me home?
Yeah, won't you take me
Ho—, o-o-o, o-o, o-o-o
Tell me does your mother know
I still love you, head to toe
Yeah, like the back of my car
on a sunny day
You're the song on the radio
like everyday
You're the words
in my soul that I wanna say
That I wanna say
Won't you let me say?
Won't you take me home?
Send me shivers somewhere
I used to go
Wrap my name across your mouth
When I let my feelings down
Darling won't you take me home?
Yeah, won't you take me
Ho—, o-o-o, o-o, o-o-o
Ho—, o-o-o, o-o, o-o-o
Ho—, o-o-o, o-o, o-o-o
Ho—, o-o-o, o-o, o-o-o
